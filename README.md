SQL Learning Platform

This project is a web-based tool to practice SQL queries directly in the browser. It includes sample databases such as Sakila and Chinook, allowing users to write, run, and test SQL queries interactively.

The app validates answers against expected results for different exercises, helping users learn and improve their SQL skills.

Built with:

React + Vite for the frontend

sql.js to run SQLite in the browser

TypeScript for type safety

The project is live and fully functional online. While some validation logic can still be improved, the platform already provides a smooth and engaging experience for practicing SQL.
